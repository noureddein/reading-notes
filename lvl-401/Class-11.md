# Data Analysis

## Jupyter Lab
### What is Jupyter Lab?
  - Jupyter is a web-based interface.
  - Jupyter can deal with multiple files e.g. csv, gif, png .. etc.


## NumPy

### What is NumPy?
  - _NumPy_ is a package used for data analysis.
  - _NumPy_ has several methods can shorten comparing with traditional way. 

### What is NumPy methods?
  1. **numpy.array()**: Used to create an array with a specific data type. 
  2. **numpy.shap**: To** get the length of rows and columns (rows,cols).
  3. **numpy.genformtxt**: Using NumPy To Read In Files.
  4. We can work with numpy array as usual like indexing, slicing , assign values to specific index, etc.
  5. Numpy works with 1-Dimensional or N-Dimensional array.
  6.  **numpy.ndarray.astype**:  convert an array to a different type.


### Things to Notice when using NumPy:
  - Each NumPy array can store elements of a single data type.
  - NumPy stores values using its own data types.
  - The core of NumPy is written in C programming language.

### NumPy Data types
  1. Float
  2. Integer
  3. String
  4. Objects
