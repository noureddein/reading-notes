# linear Regressions

## What is linear regressions?
  - Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Regression use case
  - Determining  the strength of predictors.
  - Forecasting effort
  - Trending forecast

## Types of Linear Regression
  1. Simple linear regression
  2. Multiple linear regression
  3. Logistic regression
  4. Ordinal regression
  5. Multinomial regression
  6. Discriminant analysis


## What we can do with linear regression?
  - With linear regression we can let machine learn from a data set. For example, Assume we have a data from hospital that related to diabetes patients, the data consist of age, gender, blood pressure, BMI, weight.
  - And we want to know what is the relation between diabetes and blood pressure, or diabetes, BMI, and age.
  - We can do that by teaching the machine, then we can predict if any person will have diabetes or not in future.
  - We can measure the accuracy of these data.


## What libraries we need to use linear regression?
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - sklearn
  - matplotlib 

## How the code will be divided?
  - Imports
  - Data handling, tain and test
    - Train: for teaching the machine
    - Test: testing the algorithm
  - Model selection: what algorithm to use.
  - Model fit: Training the machine.
  - Model predict: Testing the data.
  - Statistics
