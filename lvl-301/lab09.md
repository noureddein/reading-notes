# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

> Complexity mean anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify.

## What is functional programming?

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## What is pure functions?

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
- It does not cause any observable side effects.

## What is Immutability?

- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

## What is Referential transparency?

- Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
  > **pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**

## What is functions as first-class?

- Functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.

### Functions as first-class entities can:

    - Refer to it from constants and variables.
    - Pass it as a parameter to other functions.
    - Return it as result from other functions.

## What is Higher-order functions?

-Functions passed as arguments and used called Higher-order functions.

# Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability

- Refactoring mean
- Give variables a meaningful name.
- Reduce the code line to make it readable
- Helps us find bugs.
- Also helps in executing the program faster
